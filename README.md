Creator is a framework for modern responsive web development.
The framework makes it easy to universally style a complete web site without writing any CSS.

It replicates Row and Columns found in Bootstrap without the need of a parent Container with most of the same features.

The framework is small and easy to reference. You only need to reference two files, one CSS and JS file which makes it very easy to implement.


UPDATE: The framework is currently being rewritten to fix bugs and add new features. Stay tuned for version 2.0
